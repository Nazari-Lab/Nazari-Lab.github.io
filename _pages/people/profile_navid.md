- Navidâ€™s research focuses on developing data-driven optimization techniques to approximate Nash equilibrium in multi-agent systems.
- His work involves leveraging game-theoretic frameworks to model strategic interactions and decision-making under uncertainty. By employing computationally efficient methods, he transforms complex equilibrium-finding problems into tractable optimization processes, ensuring robust and adaptive control strategies for dynamic systems.
