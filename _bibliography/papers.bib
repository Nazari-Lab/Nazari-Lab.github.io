  abstract={Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for planning and controlling dynamical systems due to its capacity for handling constraints and taking advantage of preview information. Nevertheless, MPC performance is highly dependent on the choice of cost function tuning parameters. In this work, we demonstrate an approach for online automatic tuning of an MPC controller with an example application to an ecological cruise control system that saves fuel by using a preview of road grade. We solve the global fuel consumption minimization problem ofine using dynamic programming and find the corresponding MPC cost function by solving the inverse optimization problem. A neural network fitted to these offline results is used to generate the desired MPC cost function weight during online operation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in simulation for different road geometries.}

  abstract={As the most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen is a promising energy carrier for decarbonizing various economic sectors. Green hydrogen production from water electrolysis is critical to the success of this path with polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer (WE) as a key technology due to its quick dynamic response and high energy efficiency. Nevertheless, vigorous control algorithms are necessary to maximize the performance, efficiency, and useable lifetime of PEM WEs. This review attempts to collate the modeling frameworks relevant to controller design and provides a survey of various control techniques used in literature to overcome the challenges associated with the transient operation of PEM WEs. To better understand the underlying physics and the coupling between different subsystems, we first review control-oriented electrochemical, thermal, mass transport, and equivalent circuit models. We identify manipulable system variables and control knobs that can be employed for a better system operation in the next step, and finally, we discuss different controllers used in literature, including traditional control approaches, optimal control methods, and other advanced techniques such as nonlinear and neural network controllers.},

  abstract={Regenerative braking is one of the main advantages of electric propulsion systems. In such systems, the vehicle brake controller has to prioritize safety while maximizing the recovered energy at all times. This paper proposes a two-step hierarchical brake controller for a dual-motor all-wheel-drive electric vehicle. In the first step, a novel sliding mode controller (SMC) generates the total braking torque on each axle to independently control the slip on the front and rear wheels. In the second step, the torque split controller assigns motor and friction brake torques to maximize the recovered energy. By incorporating the effects of changing vehicle speed, the proposed SMC controller accounts for the nonlinearities in vehicle dynamics and tire model and considers the weight transfer due to vehicle deceleration while being robust to disturbances. Using simulations, we show that while the traditional SMC formulation is not effective during emergency braking scenarios, the proposed formulation successfully generates control commands to bring the vehicle to a stop position at a minimum distance. Furthermore, our controller can maintain both wheels in the stable slip region, even when starting from a locked position. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated for an emergency braking scenario and on an aggressive segment of the US06 cycle.}
