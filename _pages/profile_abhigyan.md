# Abhigyan Majumdar
**She/her/hers**

- Abhigyanâ€™s research focuses on the integration of physics-based and data-driven modelling approaches for electric vehicle thermal management and control.
- His work involves combining Koopman Operator theory with Gaussian Process Regression to develop robust probabilistic system models. These models support the development of optimal control strategies for uncertain environments.
- Additionally, he is working on implementing and testing ADAS algorithms on real vehicles, integrating drive-by-wire capabilities to enhance autonomous driving research within the lab. Watch the video [here](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/kvgzjqzrm4o4epdxt8uao0gik0bnpbzf).

## Education and Degree(s)
- Ph.D. Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at University of California, Davis
