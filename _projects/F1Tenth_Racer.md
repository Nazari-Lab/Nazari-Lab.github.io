The Davis Autonomous Race Car (DARC) is an innovative research platform at CORE Lab that integrates key autonomous vehicle frameworks across multiple disciplines. By combining fundamental concepts in perception, planning, control, vehicle dynamics, and real-time computing, the project has fostered a collaborative research effort between the Mechanical Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science Departments. Research teams have consistently expanded the car's capabilities, pushing the boundaries of autonomous vehicle technology through interdisciplinary innovation.

The vehicle currently drives autonomously using MPC control, and LIDAR for localization and motion planning. Current work is being done with incorporating sensor fusion using LIDAR and IMU readings with the use of an Extended Kalman Filter. By maintaining technical documentation of the software and hardware stack, the hope is that DARC will be used in live-testing more novel autonomous driving approaches.
